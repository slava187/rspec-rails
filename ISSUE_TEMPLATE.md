<!--

Hi there! Here's a few pointers to help us help you with your issue as quickly
as possible.

We prefer that the RSpec Rails issue tracker be mainly used for bug reports.
Feature requests or general requests for help should go to our google group:
rspec@googlegroups.com. We use that as our primary location for higher level
RSpec discussions.

If you are filing a bug report, there's a few steps it'd be super if you could
follow. If you can't do all of these, don't worry, but if you can it'll help us
resolve your bug faster!

-->

## Description of issue

<!--
please provide a high level description of the problem that you are having,
including details like rails version and so on
-->

## Can you provide an example app?

<!--
This step is probably the most important in allowing us to quickly debug
your issue, and we typically ask that you follow these steps:

1. `rails new` an app at the specific version of ruby and rails that you are
   using
2. commit that app, so that we have the rails skeleton in a separate commit
3. Make all the changes necessary (adding RSpec, models, specs, controllers,
   etc) to reproduce the issue. There should be a failing test or tests that you
   expect to pass. We'll run `bundle exec rspec`, but if you can provide a
   readme with more detailed instructions that'd be amazing :)
4. Commit
5. Provide a link to a github repo, a description of the app and what you're expecting here
-->

## What Ruby, Rails and RSpec versions are you using?

<!--

You can run

```
bundle exec ruby --version
bundle exec rails --version
bundle exec rspec --version
```

and paste the output below

## Did this problem exist before you upgraded to Rails 5?

<!-- We're still tracking down a few edge cases since Rails 5 came out, so if
it's new for you since Rails 5, that'll help us find it faster -->
