# Contributing

RSpec is a community-driven project that has benefited from improvements from over *500* contributors.
We welcome contributions from *everyone*. While contributing, please follow the project [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), so that everyone can be included.

If you'd like to help make RSpec better, here are some ways you can contribute:

  - by running RSpec HEAD to help us catch bugs before new releases
  - by [reporting bugs you encounter](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails/issues/new)
  - by [suggesting new features](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails/issues/new)
  - by improving RSpec's [Relish](https://relishapp.com/rspec) or [API](http://rspec.info/documentation/) documentation
  - by improving [RSpec's website](http://rspec.info/) ([source](https://github.com/rspec/rspec.github.io))
  - by taking part in [feature and issue discussions](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails/issues)
  - by adding a failing test for reproducible [reported bugs](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails/issues)
  - by reviewing [pull requests](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails/pulls) and suggesting improvements
  - by [writing code](DEVELOPMENT.md) (no patch is too small! fix typos or bad whitespace)

If you need help getting started, check out the [DEVELOPMENT](DEVELOPMENT.md) file for steps that will get you up and running.

Thanks for helping us make RSpec better!

## `Small` issues

Small issues are the ones that we be believe are best suited for new
contributors to get started on. They represent a meaningful contribution to the
project that can be made that should not be too hard to pull off.

## `Triage` issues

Triage issues are ones that have been labelled by the maintainers that we
believe do not currently have enough information for them to be reproduced by
us. You can help us move triage issues into `ready to go` or `has reproduction
case` (for feature requests or bugs) as a seriously meaningful contribution.

## `Has reproduction case` issues

Issues that have reproduction cases have a repository that we can clone that
enable us to quickly determine the issue is valid and then start debugging
within RSpec. These issues are good ones to tackle to help us actively fix bugs.

## Maintenance branches

Maintenance branches are how we manage the different supported point releases
of RSpec. As such, while they might look like good candidates to merge into
master, please do not open pull requests to merge them.
